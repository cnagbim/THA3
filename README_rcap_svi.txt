QUESTION: The purpose of this dataset is to answer the question of whether social vulnerability and racially concentrated areas of poverty have a strong dependency.

rcap_svi.csv is made of two data sets that were cleaned then merged. They were merged according to their census tract using python.

The first is from the City of Austin's Open Data portal. The data was first collected in 2012.

It describes "racially or ethnically concentrated areas of poverty"
HUD’s definition of an RCAP/ECAP is:
A Census tract that has a non-white population of 50 percent or more AND a poverty rate of 40 percent or more; OR
A Census tract that has a non-white population of 50 percent or more AND the poverty rate is three times the average tract poverty rate for the metro/micro area, whichever is lower.



The second dataset is from the Center for Disease Control (CDC). It was first collected in 2016.
It is a cleaned version the social vulnerability dataset put together by CDC.

Social Vulnerability Index measures a communities resilience and adaptability after a disaster happens.
It is broken down into 4 "theme" areas that are then aggregated to give a total vulnerability score.

The themes:
1) Socioeconomic status, 
2) Household composition and disability,
3) Minority Status and Language,
4)Housing and Transportation.
The score is a percentile of vulnerability compared to other census tract communities.
A higher score means the community is more susceptible to despair when a disaster occurs.
